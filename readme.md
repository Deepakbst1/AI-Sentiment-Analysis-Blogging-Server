Project Description 

What is the goal or objective of this project?

To develop a full-stack blogging platform that uses AI to analyze and display the emotional sentiment of user-generated content (blogs, comments) in real-time, helping users understand the tone and engage more effectively.

Problem does your project solve?

Problem: Users may unknowingly write content that feels overly negative, aggressive, or inappropriate.
Solution:App uses AI to analyze the emotional tone of blog posts and comments, providing immediate feedback on sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) so users can adjust their tone.

Problem: Blog platforms often face toxic or emotionally charged content, affecting reader experience.
Solution: Sentiment tagging helps moderators flag harmful or negative content early, promoting healthier interactions and reducing toxicity.

Problem: Readers may skip blogs without emotional context or labels.
Solution: App adds sentiment indicators to blog posts and comments, helping readers quickly assess tone and encouraging deeper, more relevant engagement.

Problem: Basic sentiment tools (like VADER or TextBlob) often fail to catch context, sarcasm, or subtle emotions.
Solution: By using OpenAI's advanced language model, your app provides more accurate and context-aware sentiment analysis, improving the quality and reliability of emotional feedback.

What technologies i use and why?
Frontend: React js - React is a fast, component-based JavaScript library ideal for building dynamic user interfaces. Easy to manage UI components, Fast updates using Virtual DOM, Easy integration with tools like Redux or Context API for state management.

 Backend: Node.js + Express.js - Node.js allows you to use JavaScript for backend logic, and Express.js is a lightweight framework that simplifies routing and API handling. 
Fast and non-blocking I/O (real-time updates), Smooth integration with MongoDB via Mongoose, Scalable and widely used for REST APIs, Easy to integrate AI services or external APIs

Database: MongoDB- MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, For storing blog posts, user data, and comments, Good performance with large unstructured data example (text content).

Authentication: JWT- JWT is a compact, URL-safe token used for stateless authentication. Secure and scalable, Allows role-based access.

AI Integration- By using OpenAI's advanced language model, app provides more accurate and context-aware sentiment analysis, improving the quality and reliability of emotional feedback.
